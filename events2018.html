									<h2><span>Emergency lanterns and chargers for Kerala Flood Relief Camps</span></h2>
								</div>

								<div class="entry-content">
									<p> After a Century, Kerala faced flood again which drowned every inch of Kerala
										causing
										disasters and every living being was mourning about one thing or other. But even
										in this
										situation, Students from IEEE SB NSSCE formed a meeting how they can help and
										concluded
										with making Emergency Lanterns and Emergency Chargers.
									</p>
									<p>
										Even though many people are in
										the relief camp, they either don’t have electricity or they don’t have enough
										lights/chargers for
										all. This idea was initiated by IEEE students, students from NSSCE and alumni’s
										volunteered
										to help us and made the work more quickly. A total of 1200 Emergency lanterns
										and 50
										Emergency chargers were made. These were delivered to various relief camps set
										up in different
										districts and was also useful for repair or cleaning purposes. The emergency
										lanterns can be
										used for 1.5 days with full brightness but it lasts 3 days.
									</p>
									<p>
										The emergency lanterns and chargers cost 30 and 25 rupees respectively per piece
										but few were ready to donate money whose profit was given to Chief Ministers
										Relief Fund. The work was divided into two – in the morning, day scholars help
										to make the lanterns and chargers and in 3 NSS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING,
										PALAKKAD-8 night, the hostellers completed the work started in the morning.
										After 4 – 5 days of functioning, IEEE SB NSSCE was able to make Emergency
										lanterns and Emergency chargers as per the users need and distributed to relief
										camps at different parts of Kerala. Students and Alumni’s Volunteering was
										exceptional during the production process.
